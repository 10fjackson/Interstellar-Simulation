Contribution Guidelines
I appreciate your interest in contributing to my Interstellar Simulation project! Here's a set of guidelines to help with the contribution process.

Setup and Testing
Fork the Repository: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the current state of the repository on your account.

Clone the Repository: Once forked, clone the repository on your local machine by using the command:

git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/interstellar-simulation.git

Create a Branch: Before making changes, create a new branch on your local repository. This saves your changes and makes it easier to integrate them later:

git checkout -b <branch-name>

Install Dependencies: To run the project locally, make sure you have Python and Pygame installed. If you don't have these, you can install them using pip:

pip install pygame

Running the Simulation: Once you've made your changes, you can run the simulation by typing:

python Simulation.py

Testing: Ensure your changes don't break any functionality. Test the game after making changes.

Contributing
Commit your Changes: After making changes on your local repository, stage and commit those changes.

git add .
git commit -m "<commit-message>"

Push to GitHub: Push your changes to your forked repository.

git push origin <branch-name>

Create a Pull Request: Go to your repository on GitHub and click on "Compare & pull request" to create a new pull request.

Code Standards

Indentation: Use correct indentation.
Comments: Write clear comments to explain your code.
Variable Names: Use meaningful variable and function names that show their purpose.

Evaluating Pull Requests
Pull requests will be evaluated based on the following:

I will review the pull request, examining the changes made and making sure they align with the project's objectives.
I will then check the quality of the code.
TThe changes will be tested to ensure they don't break the functionality and solve the issue they were meant to solve.
Once all issues have been addressed, the pull request will be merged.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to my Interstellar Simulation project! Your contributions are greatly appreciated.
